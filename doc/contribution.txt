CONTRIBUTION
Compiler and Virtual Machine for a Programming Language(MADS)


Team 12 :-
Team Members:
1] Ashwin Srinivasan
2] Deepti Paul
3] Madhu Madhavan
4] Srinivasan Sundar


Milestone 1
Tasks:
Researched on the language and tools to be used for the project. 
Understood the project requirements and gathered information for the entire project design.
Considering our research on the various parsing tools and other project related information, we have identified the best tools and languages for effectively implementing our project, as mentioned below.
All the members also contributed towards writing the grammar. Finally, named our programming language as MADS.


Future plans and tasks to be completed:
1. Write Grammar for ANTLR in the .g4 format. ( Ashwin Srinivasan, Madhu Madhavan )
2. Debug and test grammar, fix the edge case issues. Research on tokenizing and generating parse trees.  (  Srinivasan Sundar,   Deepti Paul )
3. Implement the compiler for basic arithmetic operator, relational operator, logical operator, conditional statements, boolean expression, iterative operator and consecutive declaration.  ( Srinivasan Sundar,  Madhu Madhavan, Deepti Paul,  Ashwin Srinivasan )
4. Implement the runtime for basic arithmetic operator, relational operator, logical operator, conditional statements, boolean expression, iterative operator and consecutive declaration.   (  Deepti Paul,  Ashwin Srinivasan)
5. Bug fixes and documentation.  (  Srinivasan Sundar,  Madhu Madhavan )


Future Works:
* Operator precedence
* Handling keywords in identifier
* Support for functions
* Console input/output or command line args to get user inputs
